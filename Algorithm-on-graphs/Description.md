# Week 1-5 Coursera's "Algorithms on Graph"

Here are the problems that I solved during week 1-5 of the course "Algorithms on Graphs" on Coursera from UCSD. I tried to document the codes as well as the problem desciptions. However, these are just the few first codes that I upload on Github, so there will be limitations to the documentations process. I will try my best in the future respositories to be more organized and desciptive.
